Workshop for DataStax Java Driver programming

### Motivation

Basic programming for Cassandra is a key topic that DataStax Solution Engineers must explain to new prospects.    

This workshop provides the tools to introduce Java Driver programming in a simple and painless manner.  We take a "practitioner" approach, with minimal focus on internals.

### What is included?

Studio notebooks, executable code, and a corresponding presentation (with detailed speaker notes) walk the students through the most important capabilities of driver programming, using the following labs:

1. Driver options and connectivity
2. Simple Statements
3. Prepared and Bound Statements
4. Batch Statements
5. Queries, including Result Set iteration and QueryBuilder
6. Query Pagination
7. Query Pagination with a Search Index
8. Mapper
9. Asynchronous Operations
10. Building a .pom

### Business Take Aways

This workshop shows developers how they can be successful with DSE.

### Technical Take Aways

After completing this basic workshop, developers will be capable of independent research into more advanced topics.
